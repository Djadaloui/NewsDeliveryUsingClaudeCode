STDOUT:
I need your permission to access web sources (WebFetch and WebSearch) to gather the latest news. Once you grant these permissions, I'll be able to:

1. Fetch content from the specific database and AI blogs you mentioned
2. Search Hacker News for relevant stories
3. Compile everything into a formatted digest

Would you like to approve the WebFetch and WebSearch permissions so I can proceed with generating your daily digest?

Alternatively, if you have any existing news sources or RSS feeds saved locally, I could work with those instead.
